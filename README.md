Java Design Pattern Essentials

Creational 

	Abstract Factory - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

	Builder - Separate the construction of an object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

	Factory Method - Define an interface to create an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

	Prototype -  Specify the types of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying the prototype.

	Singleton - Ensure a class allows only one object to be created, providing a single point of access to it.

Structural -- Help manage how classes are organized and interrelate

	Adapter -  Convert the interface of a class to another interface that clients expect.  Adapter lets classes work together that coiuldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
	
	Bridge - Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that each may vary independently.
	
	Composite - Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.  Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
	
	Decorator - Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.  Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub-classing for extending functionality.
