Java Design Pattern Essentials

Creational 

Abstract Factory - Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Builder - Separate the construction of an object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

Factory Method - Define an interface to create an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
